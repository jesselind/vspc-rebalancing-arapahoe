# Output Directory

This directory contains the **generated output files** from running `generate_assignments.py`.

## Generated Files

When you run `generate_assignments.py`, it creates three CSV files:

1. **`VSPC - Precinct Distribution.csv`**
   - One row per precinct (403 rows)
   - Shows nearest VSPC, assigned VSPC, distances, reassignment status
   - Includes voter counts and VSPC address information

2. **`VSPC Locations.csv`**
   - One row per VSPC (32 rows)
   - Shows total voters and precincts assigned to each VSPC
   - Includes VSPC address information

3. **`Summary Statistics.csv`**
   - Overall statistics: total VSPCs, total precincts, total reassigned

## Status

This directory is currently empty. Run `generate_assignments.py` from the root directory to generate these files.

## Git Tracking

These output files **are tracked in git** as they represent important results of the rebalancing process. They can be regenerated by running `generate_assignments.py`, but tracking them in git allows you to:
- Compare results over time
- See what assignments were generated at different points
- Share results with others without needing to run the script
