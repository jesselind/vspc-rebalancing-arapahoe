Overview,This workbook assigns Arapahoe County election precincts to county-approved Voter Service and Polling Centers (VSPCs) for organizational and staffing purposes. Two assignment models are provided: Geographic and Rebalanced.
Geographic (GEO) Assignment,"Definition: Each precinct is assigned to the single closest VSPC based on straight-line distance from the precinct centroid.
Purpose: Establishes the natural, geography-based baseline assignment.
Use when: Validating proximity, auditing assignments, or understanding default county geography.
Do NOT use for: Final staffing decisions if precinct loads are uneven."
Rebalanced Assignment,"Definition: A controlled reassignment of some precincts to nearby VSPCs to achieve balanced voter volume across VSPCs (target based on total voters divided by number of VSPCs).
Constraints: Precincts may only be reassigned to their second-closest VSPC; east/west cross-county jumps are prohibited.
Rural exception: Rural VSPCs may exceed the target due to geography.
Use when: Final operational planning and staffing."
Sheet Usage,"Use GEO sheets to understand natural geography.
Use REBALANCED sheets for staffing, leadership assignment, and execution.
Never mix GEO and REBALANCED data in the same operational workflow."
