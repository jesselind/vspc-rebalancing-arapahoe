# Historical Version: v12

This directory contains **v12**, a previous iteration of the VSPC rebalancing system.

## Status: Historical Reference

**This version is preserved for historical reference only.** The current codebase uses version-agnostic files in the root directory.

## Current System

The current system is version-agnostic and uses:
- `generate_assignments.py` in the root directory (based on v14)
- `output/` directory for results
- Git history for version tracking

All historical versions (v1-v14) are preserved in their respective directories for reference and to show the evolution of the project.

## Files in This Directory

The files in this directory represent the state of the project at the time of v12. They are preserved as-is for historical reference.

See `../README.md` for information about the current system.
See `../VSPC_REBALANCING_CONTEXT.md` for detailed version history and algorithm evolution.
